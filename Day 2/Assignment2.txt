Question1 Answer:

first for loop run for n times  - O(n)
second loop run for m times  - O(m)
Total complexity = O(n+m)
which is simplified as O(n).


Question2 Answer:

B) X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs

The option B is correct because in case of asymptotic analysis an algorithm X is said to be
more efficient while it work excellent with  large input size than the other algorithm Y.
